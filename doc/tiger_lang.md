The Tiger Language
==================

Tiger is a small programming language defined in _Modern Compiler Implementation in ML_ by Andrew Appel (Cambridge University Press, 2004). The base Tiger language consists of nested functions, record values with implicit pointers, integer and string variables, arrays, and simple imperative language control constructs. It can be extended with object-oriented and functional features.
